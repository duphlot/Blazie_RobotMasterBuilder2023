## The inspiration
- In Vietnam, most families use a manual gas stove which means that we have to stay in a safe zone in order to observe the cooking process.
- Children may get their hands burnt due to playing with the gas stove

=> We suggest, design and produce our semi-automatic gas stove timing and tuning robot.

## How does it function?
- The users can set the level of fire and time for cooking.
- The robot has 3 levels in total and unlimited time set (we can cook until it runs out of gas).
- It can turn off the stove autonomously.
- Avoid children from burning their hands.

## Components
- 1 Arduino Nano
- 1 Servo MG996R
- 1 I2C LCD monitor
- 1 MQ06 Gas sensor
- Control buton
- 3D printed shield and gears
- Power supply by 3.7Vx2 batteries
